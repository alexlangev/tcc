## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.

## Concepts and Vulnerabilities

### Old syntax of declaring a constructor

In solidity, contract can have a `constructor` function. This function runs only once **at contract deployment**. It is used
to set up important logic. Amoung other things, it is used to instantiate immutables and very often it is used to 
set an `owner` of the contract.

In Solidity versions pre 0.7.0, you could create a `constructor` function by creating a `public` function with the _same name as the
contract_. This wasn't the best idea since having a **single typo** would result in creating a **public function that handles
critical behavior**. In this level, the contract is named `Fallout` but the function supposed to be the `constructor` is named `Fal1out`.

```solidity
function Fal1out() public payable {

  function Fal1out() public payable {
    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
  }

}
```

The function `Fal1out` is therefore a **public function** that can be called by any address. It gives the ownership of the contract
to the `msg.sender`. We'll use this solve this challenge.

## Solution

As mentioned above, the contract is supposed to have a `constructor` named `Fallout` but due to a typo, it instead has a public function
names `Fal1out`.

1. Simply call the `Fal1out` function. This will transfer the ownership to you. I used <a target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a>
to do this.

## Suggested mitigation

If this was a contract submitted to an audit I would suggest the following:

- Fix the typo to `Fallout`.
- If possible, update the Solidity version to at least 0.8.0 and use the `constructor` keyword instead, like
  the following:

```solidity
constructor() {
  owner = msg.sender;
  allocations[owner] = msg.value;
}
```
