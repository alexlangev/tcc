## Objectives

1. In less than 10 Opcodes, write a contract that returns 42 when you call `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife`.

## Solution

As explained in the beginning of <a target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" hre="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/deconstructing-a-solidity-contract-part-ii-creation-vs-runtime-6b9d60ecb44c">this article</a>,
we will write our bytecode in **two sections**.

The first section is the **initialization** part of the code. This code is only _executed once during the transaction that
creates the contract_. From what I understand, this is where the constructor logic is executed, which sets the initial states.

The second section is the **runtime** part of the code. This is the actual code that is stored at the contract address onchain.
It's what is _executed every time a function of the contract is called_.

### Opcodes

Let's go over each **opcode** that we will use.

- `PUSH1` pushes a 1-byte value onto the stack.
  the second one is the value to be stored. It then writes the 32-byte balue into memory at the specified
  starting address.
- `RETURN` returns from this contract call.
- `CODECOPY` copy executing contract's bytecode. It takes three arguments, the destination memory, the
  source in th e code frmo where to start the copy and the number to copy.
- `MSTORE` writes a uint256 to memory. It take two arguments, the first is the starting memory address and

### Initialization

1. `PUSH1` `0a`: Push the size of the runtime code `0x0a` onto the stack.
2. `PUSH1` `0c`: Push the position where the runtime code starts `0x0c` onto the stack.
3. `PUSH1` `00`: Push the memory location where to copy the runtime code `0x00` onto the stack.
4. `CODECOPY`: CODECOPY opcode copies the runtime code into memory.
5. `PUSH1` `0a`: Push the size of the runtime code `0x0a` onto the stack again.
6. `PUSH1` `00`: Push the memory location of the runtime code `0x00` onto the stack.
7. `RETURN`: RETURN the runtime code from memory.

The above code is tranlated to `600a600c600039600a6000f3` in opcodes.

### Runtime

1. `PUSH1` `2a`: Push the `0x2a` on top of the stack.
2. `PUSH1` `50`: Push `0x50` on top of the stack.
3. `MSTORE`: Store value `0x2a` at position `0x50` in memory.
4. `PUSH1` `20`: Push `0x20` on top of the stack.
5. `PUSH1` `50`: Push `0x50` on top of the stack.
6. `RETURN`: Return `0x42` of size 20.

The above code is tranlated to `602a60505260206050f3` in opcodes.

### Tying it all together

Concatenating the **initialization** bytecode followed by the **runtime** bytecode gives the following bytecode:
`600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60505260206050f3`.

We can deploy the contract using the web3 libraby directly in the console.

```javascript
const code = "600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60505260206050f3";
const tx = await web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: player, data: code });
await contract.setSolver(tx.contractAddress);
```
