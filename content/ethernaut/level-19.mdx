## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract

## Vulnerabilities

### Storage array arithmetic overflow and underflow

In Solidity prior to 0.7.0, the `length` property of dynamic arrays could be modified. This length can
**underflow** and **overflow**. We'll utilise this fact in this level.

## Exploit

1. Call `makeContact` to change the value of `contact` from `false` to `true`.

2. Call `retract` to shorten the length of `codex` by one. Since codex is currently uninitialzed, it's length
   is currently 0 and will **underflow** which causes the length to grow to <InlineMath>{'2^{256}'}</InlineMath>.
   This is also the total storage capacity of the contract. Therefore the some slots of the array will collide with
   slots for other variables.

3. Let's find out in which storage slot codex is. Since `_owner` is 20 bytes long and `contact` is byte long, they
   will share slot 0 of the contract.`codex`is therefore at slot 1. If you know how storage slots for dynamic arrays
   work, only the length value is in slot 1, the value of`codex[0]`is actually at storage slot`keccak256(1)`. All
   subsequent values of codex are in `keccak256(1) + 1`, `keccak256(1) + 2` and so on... Using some _modulo arithmetic_ we can
   determine that to collide with values in slot 0, we need to use `revise` with index `2^256 - keccak256(1)` as parameter.

   ```javascript
   const x = BigInt(
     web3.utils.keccak256(web3.eth.abi.encodeParameters(["uint256"], [1]))
   );
   const index = BigInt(2 ** 256) - x;
   ```

4. Before calling `revise`, we need to construct the value that we will give it. Since the slot is 32 bytes in total
   we will pad our address with 24 zeros.

```javascript
const content = "0x" + "0".repeat(24) + player.slice(2);
```

5. Finally let's call `revise` to override slot 0 with out address which will make us the owner.

```javascript
await contract.revise(index, content);
```

## Suggested mitigation

1. Upgrade the contract to Solidity version 0.8.0 and up. The **arithmetic underflow** will
   automatically revert the transaction. Also with Solidity version 0.6 and up, the length property
   of dynamic array are read-only.
