## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Old syntax of declaring a constructor

The contract uses Solidity version 0.6.0 which enabled you to create a constructor function simply by giving it
the same name as the contract. This is dangerous because constructors usually handle critical behavior. In this
case, the contract is named `Fallout` but the function supposed to be the constructor is named `Fal1out`.

```solidity
function Fal1out() public payable {

  function Fal1out() public payable {
    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
  }

}
```

The function Fal1out is therefore a public function that gives the ownership to the caller.

## Exploit

1. Call the `Fal1out` function.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Fix the typo to `Fallout`.
2. If possible, update the Solidity version to at least 0.8.0 and use the constructor keyword instead like
   the following:

```solidity
constructor() {
  owner = msg.sender;
  allocations[owner] = msg.value;
}
```
