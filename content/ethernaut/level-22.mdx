## Objectives

1. Using **price manipulation**, steal all of one of the two **ERC20** tokens.

## Vulnerabilities

### Bad swap price formula

The `swap` price formula is sensitive to the total quantity of tokens held by the contract. Especially since the total
quantity of tokens is so low,

## Exploit

1. `approve` the transaction of 10 token 1 by the contract.
2. `swap` 10 token 1 for 10 token 2 (Your balance will then be 0 token 1 and 20 tokens 2)
3. Do the same as in steps 1 and 2 but the other way around and with your new balance which is 20. (You will then have
   24 token 1 and 0 token 2).
4. Repeat this process until you have emptied the balance of one of the tokens. I ended up with 110 of token A and 20 of token B.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Drastically increasing the token pool would help mitigate this somewhat.
2. Finding a better swap price formula to mitigate manipulation risks.
3. Use an oracle like Chainlink to get the swap price
