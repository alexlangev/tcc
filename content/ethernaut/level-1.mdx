## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.
2. Steal all of the funds.

## Concepts and Vulnerabilities

### Receive function

In Solidity, contracts can have a `receive` function which is always `external` and
`payable`. This function gets executed when a contract directly receives Eth without 
any accompanying `calldata`. In other words, when a contract is sent a transaction 
_without any function calls_.

### Flawed access control

The contract uses a `onlyOwner` function modifier which is a common pattern. That being said,
an improper implementation of the `onlyOwner` logic can __expose critical functions__.

In this particular case, the `receive` function which anyone can call assigns `msg.sender` 
as `owner` if a `require` function is successful. This is exactly what we will use to exploit
the contract.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
  require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
  owner = msg.sender;
}
```

## Solution

As mentioned above, we want to exploit the logic inside the `receive` function which assigns a new owner to `msg.sender`.
For this, we need to satisfy the `require` function. There are two conditions:

1. `msg.value` > 0 
2.  `contributions[msg.sender] > 0` is also simple. All we need is to increase the contribution of our EOA to a positive
amount.

The first one is simple. Sending any amount of Wei to the contract will satisfy this. On the other hand, the second condition
requires an extra step. We need to increase the contribution value of our EOA to an amount greater than 0. Let's do exactly this
by calling `contribute` alonside 1 Wei. (It can be any value between 1Wei and 0.001 Eth)

We can now send 1 Wei to the contract address. Doing this will make your EOA the `owner`. I used the <a target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" hre="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a>.
interface to do this but you can also do it directly in the console.

Lastly call `withdraw` to empty all of the contract's funds.

## Suggested mitigation

If this was a contract submitted to an audit I would suggest the following:

- Remove the ownership assignment behavior from `receive` and put it into a function with a `onlyOwner` modifier. 
For example:
```solidity
function changeOwner(address _newOwnerAddress) external onlyOwner {
    require(_newOwnerAddress != address(0), "Can't use the 0 address!");
    owner = _newOwnerAddress;
}
```
- For bigger projects, using the `Ownable` library by OpenZeppelin would be a safer option.
