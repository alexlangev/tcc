## Objectives

1. Get past the three require function modifiers and register as an entrant.

## Vulnerabilities

N/A (It's a technical skill test)

## Exploit

1. The first two require are seemly mutualy exclusive. Therefore a little imagination is required here.
   Calling the `enter` function from the constructor of your hack contract will result in successfully passing
   the second require which looks of the is contract code at the address of msg.sender.

2. Finding the value of the bytes8 key can seem daunting. That being said, the `^` operator noted as <InlineMath>\oplus </InlineMath> is reversible. Meaning that <InlineMath> a \oplus b = c \Rightarrow a \oplus c = b</InlineMath>.

3. With those two ideas in mind, write and deploy the following contract to make yourself the `entrant` :

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./GatekeeperTwo.sol";

contract GatekeeperTwoHack {
    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        GatekeeperTwo target = GatekeeperTwo(_targetAddress);
        bytes8 key = bytes8(type(uint64).max ^ uint64(bytes8(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address(this))))));

        target.enter(key);
    }
}
```
