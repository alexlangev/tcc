## Objectives

1. Unlock the contract. In other words, change the `locked` variable to `false`;

## Vulnerabilities

### Unencrypted private data on chain

`private` storage variables are _hidden from other contracts_ but **visible to anyone** on the blockchain. Storing private data
like passwords or personal information is dangerous since their values are visible.

## Exploit

1. Following the <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Layout of State Variables in Storage rules</a>,
   figure out in which _storage slot_ the `data[2]` is located. The answer is slot 5 since `flattening`,
   `denomination` and `akwardness` all share a single slot.

2. In the console, use the following to read the value in slot 5.

```javascript
const preKey = web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 5);
```

3. Remove the last 16 bytes using `substr(2,32)`.

```javascript
const key = preKey.substr(2, 32);
```

4. Call `unlock` with the remaining 16 bytes as argument.
