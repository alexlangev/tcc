## Objectives

1. Unlock the contract. (change the `locked` variable to false)

## Vulnerabilities

### Saving private data as private

`private` storage variables are hidden from other contracts but visible on the blockchain. Storing
unencrypted passwords as private variables is dangerious since their values are avaialble to everyone.

## Exploit

1. Figure out in which storage slot `data[2]` is located. (it's in the 5th index)

2. In the console, use `await web3.eth.getStorageAt("0xc7a7d427bAc3B3238D5DC6d2950692D996619F37", 5);` to read the value.

3. Remove the last 16 bytes using `.substr(2,32)`.

4. Call `unlock` with the remaining 16 bytes as argument.
