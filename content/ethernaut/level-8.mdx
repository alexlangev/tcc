## Objectives

1. Unlock the vault (change the `locked` to `false`).

## Vulnerabilities

### Saving private data as private

`private` storage variables are hidden from other contracts but visible on the blockchain. Storing
unencrypted passwords as private variables is dangerious since their values are avaialble to everyone.

## Exploit

1. Find out in which storage slot the variable `password` is located. (slot 1)
2. In the console, use `web3.eth.getStorageAt` to read the value located at storage 1.
3. Call `unlock` with the password as argument.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Store encrypted passwords or use an offchain solution.
