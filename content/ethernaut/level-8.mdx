## Objectives

1. Unlock the vault. In other words, change the `locked` variable to `false`.

## Vulnerabilities

### Unencrypted private data on chain

`private` storage variables are _hidden from other contracts_ but **visible to anyone** on the blockchain. Storing private data
like passwords or personal information is dangerous since their values are visible.

## Exploit

1. Following the <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/internals/layout_in_storage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Layout of State Variables in Storage rules</a>,
   figure out in which _storage slot_ the variable `password` is located. It's slot 1.
2. In the console, use the following to read the value in slot 1.

```javascript
const password = web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, 1);
```

3. Call `unlock` with the password as argument.

## Suggested mitigation

- Store encrypted private data.
- Use an offchain solution instead.
