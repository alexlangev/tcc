## Objectives

1. Get past the three `require` function modifiers and register as an entrant.

## Vulnerabilities

N/A, It's a technical skill test.

## Exploit

1. Using a contract to interact with the `GatekeeperOne` contract will satisfy the first `require` condition
   since `tx.origin` and `msg.sender` will be different.

2. The key is based on `tx.origin`. You will need to do multiple casts in a row and rely on some bit shifting to find it:

```solidity
uint64 preKey = uint64(1 << 62) + uint64(uint16(uint160(tx.origin)));
bytes8 key = bytes8(k64);
```

3. Finding the correct gas amount is quite tricky. It will vary based on which compiler version you are using among other things. Testing
   all possible gas amounts using foundry until it works is a good way to do it.

```solidity
function test() public {
    for (uint256 i = 100; i < 8191; i++) {
        try hack.enter(address(target), i) {
            console.log("gas", i);
            return;
        } catch {}
    }
    revert("all failed");
}
```

4. Once you have the correct gas amount, call `enter` with with gas. I ended up needing `256 + 3 * 8191` gas. I tried with `256 + 2 * 8191` and
   `256 + 8191` but it didn't work for some reason. It might be related to the amount of gas needed to complete the rest of the transaction.
