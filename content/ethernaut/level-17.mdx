## Objectives

1. Recover the 0.001 eth from the lost `SimpleToken` contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Transaction information is publically available

All transaction data is publically available on eterscan. We can use this fact to find the lost `SimpleToken`
contract address.

## Exploit

1. Use SepoliaEtherscan to look into the `Recovery` contract.

2. Find the target address of the 0.001Eth we are looking to get back. This address will be the lost `SimpleToken`
   address.

3. Call the `destroy` function from that address with your EOA as target to claim the lost 0.001eth for yourself
   and destroying the `SimpleToken` contract in the process.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Don't rely on people not finding contract addresses.
2. Add a `onlyOwner` function modifier to the `destroy` function of `SimpleToken`.
