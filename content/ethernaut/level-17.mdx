## Objectives

1. Recover the 0.001 Eth from the lost `SimpleToken` contract.

## Vulnerabilities

### Transaction information is publically available

All transaction data is **publicly available** on etherscan. We can use this fact to find the lost `SimpleToken`
contract address.

## Exploit

1. Use <a href="https://sepolia.etherscan.io/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sepolia Etherscan</a> to look into the `Recovery` contract.

2. Find the target address of the 0.001 Eth we are looking to get back. This address will be the lost `SimpleToken` address.

3. Call the `destroy` function from that address with your EOA as target to claim the lost 0.001 Eth for yourself
   and destroying the `SimpleToken` contract in the process.

## Suggested mitigation

- Don't rely on people not finding a contract addresses.
- Add a `onlyOwner` function modifier to the `destroy` function of `SimpleToken`.
