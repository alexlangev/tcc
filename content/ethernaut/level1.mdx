## Objectives

1. Claim ownership of the contract.
2. Steal all of the funds.

## Vulnerabilities

### Flawed access control

A transfer of ownership is present in the `receive` function. This is dangerous since `receive` is a public
function. The `require` statement condition is also not very strict which open the door to anyone to become the
owner.

```solidity
receive() external payable {
  require(msg.value > 0 && contributions[msg.sender] > 0);
  owner = msg.sender;
}
```

## Exploit

1. Call `contribute` alongside a value of at least 1 wei. The balance of your address is now positive.
2. Send at least 1 wei to the contract address. This will call the `receive` function. Since the balance
   of your address is greater than 0, the require statement condition is repected and the body of the function
   will execute and the ownership will be tranfered to your address.
3. Call `withdraw` to steal all of the funds.

## Suggested mitigation

1. Move the ownership assignment into a `onlyOwner` function.
2. For bigger projects, using the `Ownable` library by OpenZeppelin.
