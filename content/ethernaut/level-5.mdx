## Objectives

1. Obtain more tokens than you start with.

## Vulnerabilities

### Integer overflow and underflow

Before Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic **overflow** and **underflow** did not _revert the transaction_.

## Exploit

1. Call the `transfer` function with your EOA and a token amount _greater_ than your current amount of 20 tokens. The require condition is satisfied
   since the uint will **underflow**.

```solidity
require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
```

Your balance will then also **underflow** to a _greater quantity than you started with_.

```solidity
balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
```

## Suggested mitigation

- If possible, update the Solidity version to at least 0.8.0. Arithmetic underflows and
  overflows now **revert the transaction by default**.

- Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeMath library.
