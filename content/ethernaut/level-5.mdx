## Objectives

1. Obtain more tokens.

## Vulnerabilities

### Integer overflow and underflow

Before Solidity 0.8.0, integer overflow and underflow did not revert the transaction.

## Exploit

1. Call the `transfer` function with a value greater than your current amount of 20 tokens.

The `require` condition of `balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0` is respected since an integer
undeflow is triggered and `balances[msg.sender] - _value` is a very big positive number.

Then `balances[msg.sender] -= _value;` will change your balance to that very big number.

## Suggested mitigation

1. If possible, update the Solidity version to at least 0.8.0. Since that version, integer undeflows and
   overflows revert the transaction by default.

2. Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeMath library.
