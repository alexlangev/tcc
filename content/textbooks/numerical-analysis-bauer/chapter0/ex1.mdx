## (a)

Let's use **Horner's method** to solve this exercise.

Rewrite <InlineMath>P(x)</InlineMath> in as a _nested multiplication_.

<BlockMath>
  {`
\\begin{aligned}
P(x) &= 6x^4 + x^3 + 5x^2 - 5x + 1 \\\\
&= 1 + x(5 - 5x + x^2 + 6x^3) \\\\
&= 1 + x(5 - x(5 + x + 6x^2)) \\\\
&= 1 + x(5 - x(5 + x(1 + 6x))) \\\\
&= 1 + x(5 - x(5 + x(1 + x * 6))) \\\\
\\end{aligned}
`}
</BlockMath>

Let's evaluate from the inside out.

<BlockMath>
  {`
\\begin{aligned}
&\\text{multiply} \frac{}{denominator}

\\end{aligned}
`}

</BlockMath>
